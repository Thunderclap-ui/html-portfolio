    <p>
      As a person with passion for technology 📱, I am constantly seeking out
      new ways to innovate and improve upon existing systems. <br />
      Whether it's coding, web design, or software development, I thrive on the
      challenge of finding creative solutions to complex problems 📕 <br />
      As I continue my academic journey, I am excited to explore new
      opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems.
      <br />
      Whether it's through internships, research projects, or other experiential
      learning opportunities, I am eager to gain hands-on experience and <br />
      make a meaningful contribution to the world around me 🐱‍👤
